Description of data exchange protocol for GREE air conditioners via UART based on reverse engineering

I am making an reverse enginering of GREE UART protocol in my free time.
I already finished the research to find a way to control and get data from my own GREE ACs and still in work for additional (maybe useful) information.
Now I'm preparing the description of all that I found out and I'm going to publish it later here.
If you are interested in my work before that you can contact me by email.
